We like feedback, GitHub stars, cool contract work, 
presumably any form of praise you can think of.

## Supporting the Project

If you want to support the project, consider buying a copy of the

Or any other, you don't have to use them! üòÄ

Thank you!

## Support for ManagedModels

Commercial support for ManagedModels is available from [ZeeZide](https://zeezide.de).
Need help to apply that to your codebase, prepare the CoreData codebase for
SwiftData.
ZeeZide can help with that
[info@zeezide.de](mailto:info@zeezide.de).

Issues with the software can be filed against the public GitHub repository:
[ManagedModels Issues](https://github.com/Data-swift/ManagedModels/issues).
